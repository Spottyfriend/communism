# Communist Theory

Communism is a stateless, moneyless system in which human society, including political and economic functions, are organised on the basis of free association. In general, these recommendations anaylse the present system - capitalism - on the basis of a communist (or adjacent) critique and, in doing so, look to what a communist society must move past. These recommendations consist of books, articles, videos, audiobooks etc. Each has a note regarding its difficulty and length.

It is *always* recommended to read, listen, or watch and discuss these recommendations together with members of your community - friends, colleagues, flatmates, fellow union members etc. Much more understanding is gained via this method, and developing your own thoughts and critiques of these recommendations will be much easier.
