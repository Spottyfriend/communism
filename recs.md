# Communist Theory

Communism is a stateless, moneyless system in which human society, including political and economic functions, are organised on the basis of free cooperation. In general, these recommendations anaylse the present system - capitalism - on the basis of a communist (or adjacent) critique and, in doing so, look to what a communist society must move past. These recommendations consist of books, articles, videos, audiobooks etc. Each has a note regarding its difficulty and length: **books** note the **page lengths** of their paperpack editions; **articles** their **word counts**; and **audiobooks** and **videos** their **duration**.

It is *always* recommended to read, listen, or watch and discuss these recommendations together with members of your community - friends, colleagues, flatmates, fellow union members etc. Much more understanding is gained via this method, and developing your own thoughts and critiques of these recommendations is made easier.

For any recommendation you wish to read/listen to/watch but do not wish to purchase, please refer to the trusted methods of media piracy listed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index/).
