# Communist Recs

Communism is a stateless, moneyless system in which human society, including political and economic functions, are organised on the basis of free cooperation. In general, these recommendations anaylse the present system - capitalism - on the basis of a communist (or adjacent) critique and, in doing so, look to what a communist society must move past. These recommendations consist of books, articles, videos, audiobooks etc. Each has a note regarding its difficulty and length: **books** note the **page lengths** of their paperpack editions; **articles** their **word counts**; and **audiobooks and videos** their **duration**. To find specific difficulties, press control+F and type, for example, 'introductory'. 

It is *always* recommended to read, listen, or watch and discuss these recommendations together with members of your community - friends, colleagues, flatmates, fellow union members etc. Much more understanding is gained via this method, and developing your own thoughts and critiques of these recommendations is made easier.

For any recommendation you wish to read/listen to/watch but do not wish to purchase, please refer to the trusted methods of internet media piracy listed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index/). Otherwise, links for books direct to the publishers' website or reputable bookshops.

First recommendation. ***Join and become active in an organisation: a union, a tenants' organisation, an anti-raids organisation, a police/prison abolitionist organisation, a radical mutual aid organisation, etc.*** If there is not one in your area, ask a national organisation whether you could get some support to set up a local branch.
